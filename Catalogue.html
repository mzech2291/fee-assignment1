        <h3>1. <u>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</u> :-</h3>

        <p><b>Author : </b>J.K. Rowling</p>
        <p><b>Review : </b> Released as a special rehearsal edition script, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is divided into two parts and is spread across four acts and various scenes. As is common knowledge for the Potter fandom, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child traces the tumultuous relationship between Harry Potter, a thirty-seven-year-old ‘overworked Ministry of Magic employee’, and his son Albus Severus Potter, who has to carry the weight of unwanted popularity and history that comes attached to his last name.

            But, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has more than that to offer. It brings our favourites Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny and the much-hated Draco Malfoy together in situations where they can’t escape each other. It also has mentions of many dead characters – Dumbledore, Cedric Diggory, Lord Voldemort, James and Lily Potter – and all of them have something to contribute in their own unique ways. The book is compelling enough, like its predecessors, to force you to not put it down. At the same time, it is a light-reading book with less text, which adds to the ease of reading.</p>

        <p><b>Author : </b>George Orwell</p>
        <p><b>Review : </b>The novel examines a futuristic society, called the World State, that revolves around science and efficiency. In this society, emotions and individuality are conditioned out of children at a young age, and there are no lasting relationships because “every one belongs to every one else” (a common World State dictum). Huxley begins the novel by thoroughly explaining the scientific and compartmentalized nature of this society, beginning at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where children are created outside the womb and cloned in order to increase the population. </p>

        <p><b>Author : </b>H.G. Wells</p>
        <p><b>Review : </b> A Victorian scientist builds a machine that can travel through time. In the distant future he finds that, rather than advancing, human civilization has totally collapsed. The Time Machine, first published in 1895, is one of the earliest known science fiction stories. This literary classic by English author H.G. Wells popularized the concept of time travel and introduced the now-common phrase “time machine.”

            This guide will organize The Time Machine into four sections. It begins with the Time Traveller showing off the time machine he invented. He journeys into the future, where humanity has evolved into the childlike Eloi and the bestial Morlocks. He then goes even further into the future and sees the end of the world. Finally, he goes back home to tell his friends what he’s seen. Our commentary will discuss the science behind the story, including which concepts are real and which are fiction. It will also discuss the literary techniques and symbolism Wells used to craft this story.</p>

        <p><b>Review : </b> 17th century France: Young D'Artagnan leaves his home and travels to Paris with dreams of joining The Musketeers of Guard—the glamourous and gallant group of men who guard Louis XIII, the King of France. There he meets Athos, Porthos and Aramis, the three best musketeers and inseparable friends who believe with all their heart in the words 'all for one, one for all.' D'Artagnan rents an apartment above the shop of one Monsieur Bonacieux, hoping to settle into Parisian life and become a proper musketeer quickly. What the young and gallant D'Artagnan does not realise is that he has, inadvertently, landed himself in the very centre of one of the foulest conspiracies in monarchist France. There are love affairs and intrigues, ambushes and wild rides, duels and murders. And as the famous American author and editor Clifton Fadiman says, 'it is all impossible and it is all magnificient.'</p>
